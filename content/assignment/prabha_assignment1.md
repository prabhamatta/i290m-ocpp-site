Include any relevant mailing list posts, wiki edits, and forum/issue tracker contributions.

# Why this course?
I have never contributed to an open source project before, however I have used it manytimes, including today when I am doing my assignment on my NLP(Natural Language Processing) course. Everytime I use python, Ubuntu or Wikipedia, I am always fascinated about the thought that someone has put in great amount of hard work in building these languages, software, information around us. I want to contribute something to the community in return but do not know how. OCPP course is a great opportunity to understand more about the open source community as well as contribute in some meaningful way to the society.

# Project Hunt: 
During the first week of the course, I started looking into various projects which have work I am familiar with so that it will be easier for me to contribute in a short time. Since I do not know how to go about it, I posted a formal introductory mail in various mailing lists like Mozilla, rediff/r/opensource, GeoNode,etc. In fact, I created a reddit and mozilla account specifically for this purpose. In this pursuit, I also talked to many classmates regarding various projects and the opportunities of work including my instructor Sebastian Benthall who helped me by introducing to GeoNode.

# Content of my introductory mail:
I mainly included the software technologies I am comfortable with such as Python, Django, HTML, JavaScript, D3, GoogleMaps, etc; and also specified my experience with open source collaboration i.e., total newbie in this area. 

# Response to my mail: 
I got variety of great responses from everyone. Responses varied from general mailing list such as /reddit/r/opensource to  specific such as GeoNode developers mailing list. On Reddit, many not only suggested projects relevant with my technical expertise, but also suggested various websites where I can find open source projects to choose from. On mailing lists exclusively specific to a project such as GeoNode developers mailing list, I received a detailed response as to how to go about starting from installation of the project on my local machine to links to various resources like documentation, installation guides, bug reports/ issue trackers, etc
